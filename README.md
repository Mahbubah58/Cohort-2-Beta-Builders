# 🎉 Say Hello to the MGSWeb3 Cohort 2 NFT!

We made it, Cohort 2! 🥳 After weeks of learning, unlearning, asking questions, and figuring things out together — we now have something to mark this journey: our very own NFT 🟣✨

It’s more than just a design. It’s a memory, a moment, and a message that says:

> “Hey, I was part of this.”

So why do we have an NFT?  
Because here in MGSWeb3, we don’t just take part — we own our story.  
This NFT is proof that you showed up, you grew, and you were part of a community that’s just getting started.

It’s a small symbol, but it carries big meaning — a reminder that we built something together, and that the journey was ours to own.

This is what community ownership looks like.  
This is what we’re building — together. 💫

Here’s to us, Cohort 2. Let’s keep going 🚀
